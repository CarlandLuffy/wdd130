      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>[My name is Carl Hylton! I'm a website designer and Frontend developer. I create
        beautiful pictures and I make websites super easy to use! My website is called
        ExtravagantFun. ExtravagantFun is a website where you can buy extravagant
        images and wallpapers to look glorious! That's not all this website has built an Ai
        voice command answering your questions as quickly as possible. Exciting right
        no more clicking your fingers away. Unlike basic websites ExtravagantFun makes
        sure your thumbnails and wallpapers are at the cheapest prices in the world with
        perfect quality. So if you want a beautiful room mixed with amazing imagery on
        your thumbnails and have 10 times more engagement and views then you are in
